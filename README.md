# Personal-Website-1
This is a personal website that I created as my first attempt at creating a website. The code provided runs through different pages written in CSS, HTML, and Javascript to provide some additional functionality 

## Main Webpage:
An HTML document that sets up the structure for a personal website. It includes links to external stylesheets and Google Fonts, and creates a container div for the top section of the webpage, a container div for the name and description of the website owner, and a div for the about section. It also includes an intro. section with an image and text and three empty divs for the projects, contact, and footer sections. 

## Javascript Email Sender:
The provided JavaScript function that sends an email when a form is submitted. It uses jQuery to get the values of the name, email, and message fields, and sends them to a PHP script using an AJAX request. The code also includes a function to check if a form field is empty, and sets the border to red if it is. If all form fields are not empty, a success message is displayed and the form is cleared.

## Javascript Projects:
This displays a list of projects with their descriptions. It includes a script tag to handle click events for each project item. When a project is clicked, its description is displayed in a paragraph element. The project list is displayed using an unordered list with unique ID attributes for each item.
